# ## Pass Statement in Python
#    - If the function or loop or condition block in Python program is not implemented yet and will be implemented later,
#    we simply add pass under it for future implementation
#    - When we execute the functions having pass under a function or loop, nothing happens

# In[1]:


# Examples:
def sum():
    pass
    
def sub():
    pass
    
def mul():
    pass

def div():
    pass


# In[2]:


sum()


# In[3]:


for i in range(1,11):
    pass


# In[4]:


a = 5
b = 4

if a > b:
    pass
